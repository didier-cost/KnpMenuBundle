KnpMenuBundle TwigFix
=============
The `KnpMenuBundle` integrates the [KnpMenu](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpMenu)
PHP library with Symfony. This means easy-to-implement and feature-rich menus
in your Symfony application!

[![Build Status](https://github.com/didier-cost/KnpMenuBundle/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/didier-cost/KnpMenuBundle/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This fork is a attempt to fix the twig deprecations in the KNP Bundle for our own project waiting for a solution.
It's also for me the opportunity to work on a fork for the first time.

## Credits

This bundle was originally ported from [ioMenuPlugin](https://github.com/weaverryan/ioMenuPlugin),
a menu plugin for symfony1. It has since been developed by [knpLabs](https://knplabs.com) and
the Symfony community.
